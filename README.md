# FizzBuzzGame


1. Used Chains of Responsibility Pattern to achieve the FizzBuzz test.
2. Used Maven to build the application
3. Created a Dynamic webproject and converted to Maven Project.
4. FizzBuzzMain is the Startup class for the project
5. kickStart method initiates the chain. The input can be passed as startRange and endRange
6. Since the input is not taken from Console, we can run it from FizzBuzzMainTest class passing values from different start and endRange.
7. Game Rules are based on input values it determines to check if it is Fizz (multiples of 3), buzz(mulitples of 5), fizzbuzz (mulitples of 15) and lucky(if number has 3).
